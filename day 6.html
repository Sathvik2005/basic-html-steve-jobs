        Steve Jobs was born in 1955 and raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions as a youth varied. After dropping out of Reed College, Jobs worked as a video game designer at Atari and later went to India to experience Buddhism. In 1976 he helped launch Apple.
